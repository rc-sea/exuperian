# Virtual Resume: Gap, Inc. Direct

Gap, Inc. Direct is the e-commerce division of Gap, Inc., responsible for the e-commerce sites of Gap, which at that point included Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic. Toby Lenk, [one of the earliest cautionary Internet startup tales with eToys](https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/gap-hires-former-etoys-chief/), had been hired as CEO of Gap, Inc., Direct to retool their e-commerce platform.

Good gravy.

Regardless, even though he had burned eToys to the ground trying to build a standalone world-class fulfillment infrastructure for online toy sales, Toby still felt any serious player in e-commerce had to build and own their own "stack" and hardware (this was pre-cloud, and even mobile, really; I remember streaming Red Sox radio with a Palm Treo for my work commute over the Bay Bridge).

We ran a bake-off between the two classic software alternatives to determine which direction the new platform would take: build vs. buy. The "buy" option would have been ATG (for the surprisingly named ATG)
