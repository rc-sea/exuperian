Only in real-world conditions can it be determined whether the technology is properly working and resonating with voters.  Even though the ElectionGuard tally in these elections would not serve as the official tally, it was nevertheless inherently intended to validate the results of the system of record.  To not either validate a valid election or invalidate an invalid one would be to fail. There were also concerns about whether ElectionGuard would overburden and slow down the voting process, especially if a lot of voters decided to challenge ballots.</p> <p>In the first election in Fulton, Wisconsin, the voting system was new to voters: would ElectionGuard make it too complex? When the voter submitted their ballot on the device, the ballot was encrypted and the confirmation code generated. The voters then went to the printing station with their smart card to print the ballot and the confirmation code. Then they went to a vote checking station to verify the printed ballot was correct. And then they could drop the ballot in a ballot box or challenge it via the ballot spoil process.  </p> <p>For the next two elections in Preston, Idaho and College Park, Maryland, ElectionGuard was integrated into Hart InterCivic's VerityScan precinct scanner, Enhanced Voting hosted the confirmation code lookup site, and MITRE wrote an independent verifier to evaluate the election record.  Voters filled out the ballot by hand (in College Park voters could also use the TouchWriter ballot marking device to print their ballot) and inserted the ballot into the VerityScan scanner to scan and encrypt the ballot, print the confirmation code, and present a results screen to the voter. Voters cast the ballot by pressing the submit button, or initiated a ballot challenge or spoil process by cancelling submission.</p> <p>In Preston, voters had the choice of using the VerityScan/ElectionGuard system or a simple ballot box (in either case, the ballots were hand marked).  Only when poll workers assured voters that the VerityScan/ElectionGuard option wouldn't take much more time did uptake increase; by election close to two out of every three voters were opting in to use the VerityScan/ElectionGuard option.</p> <p>In College Park, the VerityScan option was new to voters, but hand-marking ballots and using a precinct scanner was not .  The tally included a vote-by-mail component for absentee voters, but those voters did not receive a confirmation code.</p> <p>In-person voters in both College Park and Preston appreciated the real-time review of the scanned ballot presented by the VerityScan device coupled with the confirmation code for them to take home. Informal time and motion studies confirmed active review of the interpreted ballot, and exit polling validated the perceived utility.  No meaningful process slowdowns were created due to ElectionGuard or ballot review tasks; bottlenecks, if they occurred, were elsewhere in the process.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/04/19/improving-confidence-and-participation-in-us-elections-lessons-from-five-years-and-three-elections-with-electionguard/#specification","title":"Specification","text":"<p>ElectionGuard starts with its specification, a statement of intent about:</p> <ul> <li>what base election parameters are used</li> <li>how ballots should be encrypted</li> <li>the homomorphic properties of the encryptions</li> <li>their associated non-interactive zero knowledge-proofs</li> <li>how to perform the key and tally ceremonies of the the election guardians</li> <li>how to enable specific ElectionGuard \"configurations\" such as pre-encrypted ballots</li> <li>what validations an independent verifier should perform</li> </ul> <p>The specification provides guidance for coders to develop the SDK and independent verifier developers to validate published election records.

Thresholding requires only a pre-set quorum of guardians to need to be present to conduct the tally after a successful key ceremony of all guardians. In College Park, the tally ceremony was performed live by the election guardians on election night; five guardians were used with a quorum of three.</p> <p>While the technical rationale for the guardian ceremonies is the security overlay it provides to the encryption and tally processes, public ceremony is an act of oversight as well. In each election recognized leaders of the community were asked to serve as guardians. The software process they followed was very simple; no technical capability was necessary. Their independence, reputation, and participation together with other recognized community leaders was intended to lend the procedure wider community legitimacy.  While the elections ElectionGuard was used in were not tightly contested nor controversial, this capability could be an important component of bolstering confidence when adjudicating elections that are.</p> <p>The software process underneath the user interface is more complex. With ElectionGuard, the homomorphic properties of the encryption need to be developed and tested, and that means a whole discipline of working with data in its encrypted state.

Voters really only need to understand how to vote if they don't already (the voting system itself was new to voters in Fulton and College Park elections). Beyond that, the minimum viable takeaway was for voters to understand the meaning of the confirmation code printout generated by the voting process.  In Wisconsin, the separately printed confirmation code page provided a place to provide additional information explaining its purpose. Because we had a fully standard separate page for printing the code, we included explanatory information and where to find more on the entire process.</p> <p>For Preston and College Park, because the printout size of the code was much smaller, receipt-holders were pre-printed for each voter to store the printout generated by the scanner.
